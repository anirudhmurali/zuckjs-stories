# Zuck.js with Hasura Data API

This is a static webpage implemented with Hasura as backend for the volume. This webpage uses [zuck.js](https://github.com/ramon82/zuck.js/) to provide the "status","story" functionality to the webpage.

This quickstart repo comes with three things:
* A sample "stories" database consisting of sample details needed for the story
* A static webpage making use of Hasura Data API (jQuery) to fetch details from the stories table.
